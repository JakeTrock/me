This is a script I wrote to archive cds, much like my CD archiving script. You connect a usb cd drive(it should probably be set to auto-mount in your fstab), and swap disks when the program tells you to. All files are written out to your desktop. (This script was not tested, I just derived it from the floppy script. Please email me a correction if I was wrong)

# Wait for a CD to be inserted then copy the contents

echo "Phloppy copy, press <ctrl>C to exit"
echo "Looking for disk..."

# Go into a continuous loop always looking for a new CD
while :
    do
####### Get the mount point of /dev/sda out of the mounts file
        TEST=$(grep /dev/sr0 /proc/self/mounts)
####### If it doesn't exist, loop until it does with 1 second pause
        if [ "$TEST" == "" ]; then
                echo -ne "."
                sleep 1
        else

                set $TEST2

                # we don't want it to just be named "disk"
