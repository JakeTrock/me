I use a standing desk with a trashpicked Ergotron multi-arm, so today I'll tell you how my setup works, and you'll like it(I know I do).<br>

Starting out with the base, I have a wayfair standing desk. Not sure about the model, but they're all basically the same. My model was around 200 dollars, has a little LCD monitor, 4 preset positions and a faux-woodgrain surface. It was trivial to assemble and arrived quickly. Because the multi-arm was missing a post, I got one from an old amazon arm, however the diameters didn't match, so I drilled a hole in it and slid thru an old hex-key to hold it up. Been workin' jus peachy so far. It holds up a custom wood frame for my lappie(pretty simple to make, I've included a picture for the estute of you to reverse-engineer, but it comes down to 2 side right-angle brackets and one bent-style bracket for a chin to hold it in. The back board has VESA spaced screws with rubber domes to prevent wood damage from the VESA plate. A single thunderbolt wire goes to the laptop from my dock affixed to the back of my dell monitor. The dell monitor is connected to my monitor with displayport, and also has a usb power element for the adhesive led strip lamp I have on the bottom of my monitor(and the amber led thing I soldered to the end of it for no particular reason(seen in pic 7)).<br>

I use a penguin computing model M keyboard I trashpicked(the poor thing's pause/break key paused existing and broke off.. hwat ever will a poor boy do..), and a perixx vertical mouse I filled with pennies wrapped in gorilla tape(it really works folks, no more wrist pain). I also have my phone connected up with its magsafe usb-c as an emergency modem for when uh.. welp uhhh... the archlinux cycle takes its toll on me([no more ]NMCLI TIME BABY :))))) ). I use my pc speakers to play sound, and my normal laptop webcam. All around, a marvelous lil' setup. Not pictured is a large cardboard box of electronics equipment, wires and tools at my feet, as well as my beloved DSR-300 wrapped in bubble wrap.<br>
