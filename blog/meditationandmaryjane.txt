(The Thinkin')=========================

I recently tried Marijuana. And a couple of months before that, Alcohol. Both times, I felt the altered state but I must confess something. This sentiment is probably nothing new, but they helped me experience things I had only experienced in meditation or in "living free" without needing the forethought. Now one could spit a jaded line about how that's the disease of society, of capitalism making an instrument that can momentarily stop the Shepard's tone of panic that most all people live in. I see it as something people are forced into eventually finding nice and rationalizing. An escape from a life they didn't ask for. But as with all cures that come in a bottle(or a gummi worm), it can be abused. You're already hovering the mouse over the "x" key and arching your eyebrow like some sort of cartoon character I'm sure so I'll explain myself. When consuming substances, people often rationalize it by stating:
1.) I act like myself on this substance
2.) I'm so much more peaceful and personable on this substance
3.) Food tastes so much better/I have fun doing things I find boring on this substance

I hate to break it to you, but there's a little tenet a fella by the name of Ferris Bueller famously spit sometime in between the disco era and when I was playing webkinz "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a while, you may miss it". I only make this remark not to say "you're living wrong!" but just to help you avoid a mistake many others have made. It was within you all along. I'm sure you knew that though. Ok, ok enough with the malarkey you molasses tounged rube! Where is the cranial floppy to load in this state of mind!

The 8 qualities of being

1.) Non-judging: Be an impartial witness, inquiry, observation and investigation of one's mind-body moment to moment experience.
2.) Patience: Let life lawfully unfold. We can't push the process. Be in the now! be present.
3.) Beginner's mind: see all things as if for the first time. See with new eyes. Be open to many possibilities and outcomes
4.) Trust: Developing basic trust in process. Welcome each experience and feeling as an honored guest, no matter how bad or confusing.
5.) Non-striving: Non-doing. Not being goal-oriented, rather orienting yourself around what feels right to do.
6.) Acceptance: Seeing and being with things as they are in the present moment. It is a waste to resist, surrender to what is.
7.) Letting go: Let it be. Holding things tightly keeps the mind and body in a contracted state and prevents the natural unfolding
8.) Enjoy slowly: Don't overstimulate yourself. Only move on once you've enjoyed what you're doing as much as you need to.

If you just read all this and thought "what a loada' bull!" you're doin it wrong amigo. Either re-read it(c'mon I know you skimmed it, that's the problem at hand champ!), or realize later that you aren't tasting your food or really /watching/ your teevee.

(The Doin')============================

Sit on your bed, back against the wall, in a chair, anywhere! One of the most important things about meditation is not to see it as a chore. You don't set a timer for 15 minutes or put it in your calendar. You do it until it's done. Focus on your breath. Let your mind wander but bring it back. Enjoy the world around you with your eyes closed.

Now you've cleared your mind. Time to think. Don't think "what's wrong with me" immediately, you have to start from the start:

1.) How did I come to be this way? Dis-ease is not just what's in us, but part of the story of who we are. Listen to the story, you will be led to the truth of what happened and the emotions at the core of our authentic being.
2.) Am I willing to listen with the ears of my heart to other voices of my self speaking?
3.) How can I be with my pain of mind, body and spirit in a way that is wise, compassionate and healing?

At the end of all of this I just want to add one last thing. Don't be a revelation junkie, jumping from one guru to the next. It's just as destructive as binging TV. Often the best guru is yourself, with some simple introspective instruments like the ones above.

If all this seems like corny touchy feely crap, you're the one who needs this the most. Being jaded is a defense mechanism, it's up to you to actualize what exactly you're defending yourself against
